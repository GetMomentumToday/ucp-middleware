## Priority Gaps (MUST/SHOULD only)

### Must Fix (blocks spec conformance)

1. signing_keys in profile (JWK)
2. Webhook delivery to agent
3. Webhook JWT signing
4. Fulfillment events on orders
5. Confirmation email (or delegate to platform)
6. Dynamic payment handler filtering

### Should Fix (improves quality)

1. Tax and fee totals types
2. Remaining link types (refund, shipping, faq)
3. Fulfillment config flags
4. Discount allocations per line item
5. Retail location destinations
6. Contact fields on destinations
7. Payment handler spec/schema URLs
8. Payment instrument echo in responses
